# ReplLanguageChecker
ReplLanguageChecker basically is like the thing on github, it shows you what percentage of your repl is being used by what language. Can only be used on repl.it\

# Credits
@RayhanADev was a realllyyy big help! He did a lot of work, other than come up with the idea. 

# How to use!

First go into your repl. Then, make some stuff, then create a new repl, and copy this code! We will eventually add this as a package, so you won't have to do this. 

Then call the function `getReplLangs`, the first paramater is the user you want to it to go to. The second is what repl.

It spits out an error message that we created if the repl is private.


```
getReplLangs('RayhanADev', 'its')
``` 
It will spit this out in the output:
```
TXT: 
  36.36%
---
JS:
  18.18%
---
JSON:
  9.09%
---
CSS:
  9.09%
---
EJS:
  27.27%
```

# What we hope to add
- Make this a package
- Prints the whole Language name(e. g. JS turns to JavaScript)


# thanks bye!
